# Architecture Decisions Document

## Project: Task Management System
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Overall Architecture Pattern

### Decision: Event-Driven Architecture with Single Entry Point
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
The task management system requires real-time collaboration, notifications, and analytics capabilities. Traditional monolithic architecture would create tight coupling, but full microservices with multiple APIs adds unnecessary complexity for the current scale.

**Decision:**
Implement an event-driven architecture with:
- Single App Service as the only external API entry point
- Worker services that consume events via Kafka (no external APIs)
- Loose coupling through event streams

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Simplified client integration (single API surface)
- ✅ Loose coupling through events
- ✅ Independent scaling of background processing
- ✅ Reduced API gateway complexity
- ❌ App Service becomes critical single point of failure
- ❌ Some operations may require synchronous responses

## 2. Hosting Platform

### Decision: Azure Container Apps (ACA)
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
Need cost-effective, scalable container hosting with minimal operational overhead for a practice/production application with unpredictable traffic.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Too complex and expensive (~$38/month minimum)
- Azure App Service: Limited container support and scaling options
- Virtual Machines: High operational overhead and fixed costs

**Decision:**
Use Azure Container Apps for all services and databases.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Serverless scaling (scale to zero for cost savings)
- ✅ Simplified container orchestration
- ✅ Built-in load balancing and service discovery
- ✅ Integrated Azure ecosystem (monitoring, networking)
- ❌ Vendor lock-in to Azure
- ❌ Less control compared to Kubernetes
- ❌ Limited customization of underlying infrastructure

## 3. Database Strategy

### Decision: Database per Service with Technology Matching
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
Different services have different data access patterns:
- App Service: Transactional CRUD operations
- Notification Service: High-volume read/write operations
- Analytics Service: Time-series and analytical queries

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single PostgreSQL for everything: Simple but performance bottlenecks
- Cassandra for notifications: Over-engineered for read-heavy workload
- Managed Azure databases: Too expensive for development phase

**Decision:**
- PostgreSQL (in ACA): Core business data + notifications
- ClickHouse (in ACA): Analytics and event history
- Redis (in ACA): Caching and session management

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Right tool for each workload
- ✅ Independent scaling and optimization
- ✅ Cost-effective (containers vs managed services)
- ❌ Increased operational complexity
- ❌ Data consistency challenges across services
- ❌ Multiple database technologies to maintain

## 4. Event Streaming Platform

### Decision: Kafka (Confluent Cloud Free Tier)
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
Need reliable event streaming between services for decoupling and asynchronous processing.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Azure Service Bus: Limited free tier, expensive at scale
- Redis Streams: Simpler but less robust for production
- RabbitMQ (self-hosted): Additional operational overhead

**Decision:**
Use Confluent Cloud's free tier for Kafka topics.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Production-grade event streaming
- ✅ Zero cost for development and small production
- ✅ Managed service (no operational overhead)
- ✅ Industry standard with good Spring Boot integration
- ❌ Vendor dependency on Confluent
- ❌ Limited throughput on free tier
- ❌ Need migration path if exceeding free limits

## 5. Programming Language Choices

### Decision: Spring Boot for App Service, Python for Analytics
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
Need to balance developer productivity, ecosystem support, and performance requirements.

**Decision:**
- App Service: Spring Boot (Java) - robust enterprise features
- Notification Service: Spring Boot (Java) - consistency with main app
- Analytics Service: Python with FastAPI - better data processing ecosystem

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Spring Boot mature ecosystem for business applications
- ✅ Python excellent for data processing and analytics
- ✅ FastAPI provides high-performance async Python APIs
- ❌ Multiple languages increase complexity
- ❌ Different deployment and monitoring requirements
- ❌ Team needs expertise in both ecosystems

## 6. Authentication Strategy

### Decision: OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD B2C
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
Need secure, scalable authentication that integrates well with Azure ecosystem and supports future enterprise integrations.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Custom JWT authentication: More work, security risks
- Auth0: Additional cost and vendor dependency
- Firebase Auth: Google ecosystem lock-in

**Decision:**
Implement OAuth 2.0 using Azure AD B2C for authentication and authorization.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- ✅ Native Azure integration
- ✅ Support for social logins and enterprise SSO
- ✅ Built-in user management capabilities
- ❌ Azure ecosystem lock-in
- ❌ Additional learning curve for B2C configuration
- ❌ Limited customization of user flows

## 7. Frontend Technology

### Decision: React with Azure Static Web Apps
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
Need modern, responsive frontend with good developer experience and cost-effective hosting.

**Decision:**
React application deployed on Azure Static Web Apps with automatic CI/CD from GitHub.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Modern component-based architecture
- ✅ Rich ecosystem and community support
- ✅ Integrated CI/CD and CDN distribution
- ✅ Cost-effective hosting with generous free tier
- ❌ Client-side complexity for state management
- ❌ SEO challenges for deeply nested routes
- ❌ Bundle size management required

---

## 8. Data Consistency Model

### Decision: Eventual Consistency with Compensating Actions
**Status**: Accepted

**Context:**
Event-driven architecture requires careful handling of data consistency across service boundaries.

**Decision:**
Accept eventual consistency between services with compensating actions for critical failures.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Better system resilience and availability
- ✅ Independent service scaling
- ✅ Reduced system coupling
- ❌ Complex error handling and recovery
- ❌ User experience challenges with delayed updates
- ❌ Requires careful event ordering and deduplication
