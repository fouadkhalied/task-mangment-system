PRD: Task Management System - Version 1.0
Date: 2025-9-17
Author: Fouad
Status: Approved

1. Overview
Problem Statement
Individuals and small teams lack a simple, fast, and reliable system to track their work. Existing tools are either too complex (Jira) or too simplistic (spreadsheets), leading to context switching and missed deadlines.

Goal
Build a clean, fast, and reliable task management system that serves as a single source of truth for an individual's or a small team's workload.

Success Metrics (How we know V1 is successful)
User Retention: 40% of users who sign up are active (create or update a task) in Week 2.

Core Task Completion: 75% of tasks created are marked as "Done" or "Closed".

Performance: P95 API response time < 200ms under load.

2. User Personas
Alex (The Solo User)
Role: Freelancer, Student, Developer

Needs: A simple list to track personal todos and side-project tasks. Needs to focus on priorities.

Frustrations: Overwhelmed by complex features. Just wants to get things done.

Taylor (The Small Team Member)
Role: Member of a team of 2-5 people (e.g., a startup team, a university project group).

Needs: To see what they are responsible for and what others are working on. Needs clarity.

Frustrations: Tasks get lost in chat messages. Uncertainty about who is doing what.

3. User Stories & Requirements (V1 Scope)
P0 - Must Have (The MVP Core)
ID	User Story	Acceptance Criteria
US-1	As a User, I can create a task with a title, description, and status so that I can track work.	- Task is saved to the database
- Task appears in my task list immediately
US-2	As a User, I can view a list of all my tasks so that I can see my workload.	- List is sorted by newest first
- I can see the title and status of each task
US-3	As a User, I can update a task's status (Todo / In Progress / Done) so that I can reflect my progress.	- Status change is saved immediately
- UI updates to reflect the new status
US-4	As a User, I can assign a task to another user by their email so that we can delegate work.	- System validates the email is a registered user
- Task appears in the assignee's list
US-5	As a User assigned a task, I receive an email notification so that I know I have new work.	- Email is sent within 1 minute of assignment
- Email contains task title and link to the app
P1 - Will Not Have (Saved for V2)
Task due dates and calendars

Projects or task grouping

File attachments

Comments or threads on tasks

User profiles or avatars

Advanced search and filtering

Mobile app

4. Design & UX
Core Principle: Speed and simplicity above all else.

UI Inspiration: Linear.so, Todoist.

Key Flow: The user's main view is a single, fast-loading list of their tasks. Creating a task is a single action, not a multi-step form.

Link: Figma Prototype (You can create a simple mockup yourself)

5. Technical Considerations
Out of Scope for V1
Authentication: Use a simple email/password signup. No OAuth, SSO, or passwordless.

Real-time updates: The list will refresh on page load. No WebSockets for live updates.

Advanced architecture: V1 will be a monolithic Spring Boot app. No microservices. Event-driven patterns will be simulated internally before being split out.

6. Open Questions
What is the maximum team size we will support in V1? (Answer: 10 users per "workspace")

Will we allow users to delete tasks? (Answer: No, V1 will only allow archiving or closing.)

7. Appendix
Key Non-Functional Requirements
Availability: 99.5% uptime (accepts downtime for deployments).

Data Persistence: No data loss under normal operation.

Security: All user passwords must be hashed. All endpoints authenticated.
